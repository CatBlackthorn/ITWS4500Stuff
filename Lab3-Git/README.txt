Part 1:
I installed TaskCoach as a small local only bug tracking software, it's something I heard
was good for small projects and I wanted to actually test it and see how it is for my own
work on this group project and a few side projects.

Part 2:
Project: Vercipe
Recipe Tracking Software.
This is an online service to host your recipes, you input the recipes and you can make
changes to those recipes. Any changes will be saved and you can then see a version
history for that recipe.
